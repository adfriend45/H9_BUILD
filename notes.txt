Build approaches here to use in HYBRID9. Focus on soil hydrology for a single site first.
Also, put on GitHub.

So, to create this as a local repository (on office Linux box) first:

~\MODELS\H9_BUILD\git init

Now create the repo on GitHub using 'New repository'

Now to monitor files locally:

git add .

then commit:

git commit -m "Initial Commit"

then add existing repo:

git remote add github https://github.com/adfriend45/H9_BUILD

then push changes to github:

git push github master

Did not work as need to pull first:

git pull https://github.com/adfriend45/H9_BUILD master

Seemed to work! Now try pushing:

git push github master

Worked!

Now update code on a test branch and try pushing.

git branch test
git checkout test
git commit H9_BUILD.f90
git push -u origin test

Did not work.
vi .git/config
Change url=https to url=ssh

Next need to set up key on GitHub using https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/
then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/adfriend45/H9_BUILD

Worked! Different from on Darwin as asks for username on GitHub as well as password. Still, works!
